= Supply Chain Management Microservices

Sample application of a supply chain management application using Spring Boot 
microservices. This is for educational purposes and does not represent a real
application as that would typically be far more complex in the real world.

== Overview

This application is a simple supply chain management application that allows
users to manage products, suppliers, warehouse, inventory, orders, customers, 
shipments, and payments. The application is implemented using Spring Boot
microservices and demonstrates bounded contexts, domain-driven design, and 
event-driven architecture.

== Modules

The application is divided into the following modules:

* `product-service`: Manages products and categories.
* `supplier-service`: Manages suppliers.
* `warehouse-service`: Manages warehouses and inventory.
* `order-service`: Manages orders and customers.
* `shipment-service`: Manages shipments.
* `payment-service`: Manages payments.

== Local Development Setup

To build and run the application, you need to have Java 17, Docker, and Kubernetes 
installed on your machine. I use minikube to run a single node kubernetes cluster. 
Installing and using minikube is very simple and you can install it on Linux, Mac, 
and Windows.

=== Install PostgreSQL in Minikube

In the `k8s` directory, you will find the Kubernetes manifests to deploy PostgreSQL.
To deploy PostgreSQL in minikube, run the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f k8s/postgres-cm.yml
kubectl apply -f k8s/postgres-secret.yml
kubectl apply -f k8s/postgres-pvc.yml
kubectl apply -f k8s/postgres-deployment.yml
kubectl apply -f k8s/postgres-service.yml
----

You can check the status of the deployment using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl get pods
kubectl get svc
----

Your PostgreSQL database should be up and running. You can connect to the database
using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl run -it --rm --image=postgres:13.3 --restart=Never postgres-client -- psql -h postgres -U postgres
----
Every microservice is a Spring Boot application and can be started using the 
`gradle bootRun` command. The services can be started in any order.
